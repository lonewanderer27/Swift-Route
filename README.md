# SwiftRoute — Full Stack Developer Case Study

SwiftRoute is a fictional last-mile logistics platform built as a take-home technical assessment. Couriers use a mobile app to manage their assigned delivery jobs throughout the day — picking up parcels, marking them in-transit, and confirming delivery.

## Monorepo Structure

This is a **pnpm monorepo** with two apps and one shared package:

```
swift-route/
├── apps/
│   ├── swift-route/     # NestJS 11 backend API
│   └── swift-app/       # Expo / React Native mobile app (Expo SDK 54)
└── packages/
    ├── types/           # Shared TypeScript types (@swift-route/types)
    └── seed-data/       # Shared seed data and ID constants (@swift-route/seed-data)
```

The workspace is defined in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with hoisted node linking.

## What Was Built

### Part 1 — Backend (NestJS) ✅

A NestJS REST API serving delivery job data from an in-memory store. No database — seed data is loaded on startup across three couriers.

**Endpoints** (all under `/delivery-jobs`):

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/delivery-jobs?courierId=&status=` | List jobs by courier (required) and optional status |
| `GET` | `/delivery-jobs/all?courierId=&status=` | Same, but validates `courierId` as UUID via `ParseUUIDPipe` |
| `GET` | `/delivery-jobs/:id` | Get a single job — 404 if not found |
| `POST` | `/delivery-jobs` | Create a job (status defaults to `assigned`) |
| `PUT` | `/delivery-jobs/:id` | Full replace |
| `PATCH` | `/delivery-jobs/:id` | Partial update |
| `PATCH` | `/delivery-jobs/:id/status` | Advance status — enforces state machine |
| `DELETE` | `/delivery-jobs/:id` | Delete job (204) |

**Status state machine** enforces a strict one-way transition:

```
assigned → in-transit → delivered
```

Any invalid transition (e.g. skipping a step, reversing, or updating a delivered job) returns `422 UnprocessableEntityException`.

**Seed data** — 9 jobs across 3 couriers, each covering all three statuses:

| Courier | IDs |
|---------|-----|
| Jeon Jung-kook | `jk_assigned`, `jk_inTransit`, `jk_delivered` |
| Sophia Laforteza | `sophia_assigned`, `sophia_inTransit`, `sophia_delivered` |
| Christopher Bang | `chris_assigned`, `chris_inTransit`, `chris_delivered` |

`JOB_IDS.ian` is a non-existent ID reserved for 404 test cases.

**DTO pattern** — each operation uses an `*Input` type (snake_case, matches API body) and a `*Model` class (implements `DeliveryJob`, transforms to camelCase domain shape). The model constructor handles all transformation — e.g. converting `courier: string` → `{ id: UUID, name: string }`.

**Tests** cover the three required test groups:

1. Query param validation — missing `courierId` returns 400; valid params return 200 with filtered list
2. Status transitions — all valid transitions and invalid ones including reversals and updating a delivered job
3. `GET /delivery-jobs/:id` — returns the correct job; returns 404 for an unknown ID

Tests use real `NestJS TestingModule` instances with the real service — no mocks. Status-transition tests are stateful and ordered within a `describe` block, relying on Jest's sequential execution to carry in-memory state across `it()` calls.

### Part 2 — Mobile (React Native / Expo) ✅

The mobile app (`apps/swift-app`) is built with Expo SDK 54, Expo Router, and Tamagui. Both courier-facing screens are fully implemented and tested.

**My Jobs screen** (`app/index.tsx`):
- Lists all delivery jobs for the active courier with colour-coded status badges (assigned = blue, in-transit = orange, delivered = green)
- Skeleton loader cards shown while the initial fetch is in flight
- Error state with a "Try again" link and an empty state with a "Refresh" link
- Pull-to-refresh via `FlatList`'s `onRefresh`
- Courier switcher via an avatar button in the header that opens `CourierDialogConfig`
- Tapping a card navigates to the Job Detail screen

**Job Detail screen** (`app/delivery-job/[id].tsx`):
- Displays status badge, package type (with emoji icon), pickup/dropoff addresses, delivery notes, and timestamps
- A sticky bottom action button advances the job through the state machine (`assigned → in-transit → delivered`) and is permanently disabled once delivered
- Optimistic update: the store is patched immediately; a 3-second simulated network delay lets the loading/spinner state be visible before the real API call is fired
- On API failure, the store is rolled back to the previous snapshot and an error toast is shown via `@tamagui/toast/v2`

**State management** — Zustand `useDeliveryJobsStore`:
- `jobs`, `prevJobs`, `loading`, `error` fields
- `advanceJobStatus(id, status)` — snapshots `prevJobs` then applies the optimistic update
- `revertJobStatus(error)` — restores `prevJobs` and sets the error message
- `useCourierStore` — persists the selected `courierId` across navigation

**Hooks**:
- `useDeliveryJobs(courierId)` — fetches jobs on mount and on `courierId` change, exposes `refetch`
- `useDeliveryJob(id)` — selects a single job from the store by ID
- `useUpdateDeliveryStatus()` — orchestrates the optimistic update, simulated delay, API call, and rollback

**Tests** cover four areas:

1. `useDeliveryJobs` hook — successful fetch populates the store; loading transitions correctly; API failure sets the error and leaves jobs empty
2. `useDeliveryJobsStore` — optimistic update is applied immediately; failed update is rolled back to the previous snapshot
3. `DeliveryJobDetails` screen — renders without crashing; initial button label matches job status; spinner/disabled state appears during the API call; error toast fires and button re-enables on failure; full `assigned → in-transit → delivered` lifecycle transition

Test conventions:
- Tamagui components are shimmed with plain `View`/`React.createElement` in `jest.mock("tamagui", ...)` 
- `UNSAFE_getByProps({ id: "..." })` locates elements because shimmed Tamagui components don't support `testID`
- `useUpdateDeliveryStatus` has a 3-second simulated network delay; tests use `jest.useFakeTimers()` and `act(() => jest.advanceTimersByTime(3000))` to advance past it (marked with `TODO` comments to remove once the delay is dropped)

## Shared Types (`packages/types`)

Package name: `@swift-route/types`. No build step — imported directly from source via the monorepo workspace.

```ts
DeliveryStatus  // "assigned" | "in-transit" | "delivered"
PackageType     // "document" | "perishable" | "fragile" | "appliance" | "furniture"

type Courier      = { id: string; name: string }
type DeliveryNote = { id: string; createdAt: Date; deliveryId: string; note: string }
type DeliveryJob  = { id, createdAt, updatedAt, pickupAddress, dropoffAddress,
                      packageType, status, notes, courier }
```

`DeliveryStatus` and `PackageType` are defined as `const` objects rather than TypeScript `enum` to work around a known incompatibility between the NestJS boilerplate and TypeScript 5.7+.

---

## Shared Seed Data (`packages/seed-data`)

Package name: `@swift-route/seed-data`. No build step — imported directly from source.

Exports `COURIER_IDS`, `JOB_IDS`, `courierStore`, `deliveryNotesStore`, and `deliveryJobsStore`. Both the backend in-memory store and mobile tests import from here to guarantee consistent fixtures across the entire monorepo.

`JOB_IDS.ian` is a non-existent ID reserved for 404 test cases.
